## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 2 (Aggressive, defensive start)
Rapport: 3 (Minimal; transactional)
Discovery: 6 (Uncovered key facts: Shopify, ad spend, product category)
Objections: 8 (Handled "tried SEO" and "burned by agencies" well)
Close: 9 (Secured email and booked meeting)
Overall: 6 (Effective but abrasive; success despite poor rapport)

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener creates immediate friction and sounds evasive.
  Fix rule: State your name, company, and the specific reason for your call in the first 10 seconds.
  Better line: "Hi Sarah, this is Trent from [Agency]. I help ecommerce brands like yours increase organic revenue from their Shopify store—I'll be quick."

- Issue: The "Do you want more revenue?" question is condescending and wastes time.
  Fix rule: Assume the desired outcome and frame your call around a specific, common problem.
  Better line: "The reason for my call is I see a lot of brands spending on ads while their product pages are missing easy SEO wins that could bring in consistent revenue."

- Issue: Jumping to price range ($2k-$6k) before establishing value or diagnosing need.
  Fix rule: Never volunteer pricing before the prospect asks for it or you have fully qualified the opportunity.
  Better line: "The investment varies based on the scope we'd define, but first, let me show you the specific opportunity. Can I send you a one-page audit?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "We've tried SEO. It's useless."**: "Most do. The issue is usually focusing on blog traffic instead of your revenue pages. We fix the technical structure and internal links so Google ranks your products, not just articles."
2. **To "We already have an in-house writer."**: "Perfect. We don't replace your writer. We provide the strategy—telling them exactly which product pages to optimize and how to link them—so their work directly drives sales."
3. **To "We've been burned. Agencies over promise."**: "I get that. I'm not asking for a commitment. I'm asking you to judge some proof. If this audit doesn't show clear, actionable gaps, we part ways. Fair?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Hi Sarah, Trent from [Agency]. We help Shopify brands get more sales from SEO on their product pages."
2. "I'm calling because most brands we work with are spending on ads while their collection pages have technical issues blocking free revenue."
3. "The common mistake is agencies chasing blog traffic instead of fixing what ranks your hero products."
4. "Is your site on Shopify?"
5. "Got it. The fastest wins are usually technical fixes and internal linking structure for your collections."
6. "To see if this is relevant, I can send a focused, one-page audit of your top product category."
7. "It would show 3-5 specific technical fixes and keywords your competitors rank for that you could own."
8. "If it's not valuable, you can ignore it. If it is, we can do a quick 15-minute walk-through."
9. "What's the best email to send that to?"
10. "To make it targeted, what's your number one product category?"

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
"Hi Sarah, this is Trent from [Agency]. We help ecommerce brands increase revenue by fixing the SEO on their Shopify product and collection pages—the ones that actually make sales. I'll be quick. Most brands we talk to are spending on ads but have simple technical issues and poor internal links blocking free, consistent revenue from Google. I'm not selling blog posts. I focus on ranking your money pages. To see if there's an opportunity for you, I'd like to send a one-page audit. It would pinpoint 3-5 specific fixes and show keywords your competitors rank for in your main product category. If it's weak, delete it. If it's solid, we can do a 15-minute walk-through. What's the best email to send it to?"
