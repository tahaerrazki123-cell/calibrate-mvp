## 0) Context Check
Cold call to a barbershop owner/manager. Rep is selling a website rebuild and ongoing maintenance package. The goal is to book a call or send examples. The prospect engaged and a follow-up is set.

## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 7 - Direct, asks for permission, but "Foreign" is unprofessional filler.
Rapport: 8 - Good use of "makes sense," validates prospect's current setup.
Discovery: 9 - Excellent. Asks key questions (last update, average cut, priority).
Objections: 9 - Handled "already have a site," "cost," and "tech stuff" very effectively.
Close: 10 - Secured permission to text, booked a specific 10-minute call time.
Overall: 9 - A very strong, efficient, and outcome-oriented cold call.

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Unprofessional opener ("Foreign. Yo,").
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Start with a clear, confident, and professional greeting.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Hi, is this the owner or manager at King's Cut?"

- Issue: Premature feature dump before fully diagnosing the pain.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): After identifying a problem, get confirmation it's a priority before presenting your solution.
  Better line (word-for-word): "If that's causing you to miss out on bookings, would fixing it be a priority?"

- Issue: Slightly aggressive transition from "maybe" on value to a specific monetary close.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Use the quantified value as a bridge to a soft question about next steps, not a direct assumptive close.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Seeing that potential, would it make sense to see a couple of examples of what that fix looks like for shops like yours?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. To "We already have a website": "Got it. When's the last time you updated it? Like in the last month or has it been sitting?"
2. To "I'm not trying to spend crazy money": "Totally fair. What's an average cut for you? 30, 40, 60?" (Then ties cost to ROI).
3. To "I don't want to deal with a bunch of tech stuff": "That's the whole point. You don't. You text us photos and changes. We handle it. No logging into anything."

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. Hi, is this the owner or manager at [Prospect]?
2. Trent here. I'll keep this to 20 seconds—if it's not relevant, just say so.
3. Quick question: when people find you on Google, can they book in two taps and see clear photos, prices, and hours?
4. Makes sense. Many shops rely on Instagram, but if your Google presence is slow or outdated, you're handing clients to the competition.
5. If that's costing you bookings, would fixing it be a priority?
6. We specialize in turning barbershop websites into appointment machines.
7. For example, if your site pulled in just five extra cuts a week at [Average Cut Price], that's [Proof Result] more per month.
8. Our package is a one-time rebuild plus simple monthly maintenance so it never gets outdated again.
9. And the best part—you text us updates. Zero tech hassle for you.
10. I can text you two live examples right now. If you like the style, we can hop on a quick 10-minute call to see if it fits.

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
"Hi, is this the owner or manager at [Prospect]? Trent here. I'll be quick. When clients find your barbershop on Google, can they book in two taps and see clear photos, prices, and hours? [If yes/no] Understood. The issue is, if that site is slow or outdated, you're literally sending clients to the shop down the street. We fix that by building a mobile-first site that acts as a 24/7 appointment machine and handle all the updates for you—you just text us new photos. If it could secure even a few extra bookings a week, would seeing a couple of real examples be helpful? I can text them right now."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hey, is this the owner or manager? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? Quick question: when people Google your shop, can they see prices and book in two taps, or do they bounce? A slow site sends clients to the shop down the street. We build a fast mobile site and handle updates so you don’t have to. Our shops see [Proof Result] in bookings. Can I text you two local examples?
