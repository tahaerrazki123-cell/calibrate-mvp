## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: The opener is generic and not tailored to the prospect's specific business role or industry.
  Fix rule: Immediately identify the decision-maker and state your specific, relevant purpose.
  Better line: "[Prospect], this is [Rep] with [Company] - do you handle the marketing or site performance for [Brand]?"

- Issue: The initial value claim is too feature-focused ("AI receptionist that answers...").
  Fix rule: Lead with the core business pain and outcome, not the product's mechanics.
  Better line: "We help businesses stop losing revenue from missed customer opportunities."

- Issue: The "permission" ask is weak ("quick one...20 seconds...you can stop me").
  Fix rule: Ask for permission to ask a specific, high-impact question.
  Better line: "Can I ask one quick question about your site's revenue?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **Objection:** "we already have voicemail and online booking."
   **Response:** "Totally. Quick question. When someone calls in pain and hits voicemail, do they wait or call the next dentist?"

2. **Objection:** "Is this like a call center? We don't want something that sounds robotic."
   **Response:** "Fair concern. It's a branded voice that uses your scripting...if it's unsure, it transfers or schedules a callback."

3. **Objection:** "maybe, but we are not looking for big changes right now."
   **Response:** "Understood. Let me ask, are you trying to grow new patients this quarter or are you more focused on retention...?"

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
[Prospect], this is [Rep] with [Company] - do you handle the marketing or site for [Brand]? Quick question: when shoppers find your key products via search but don't convert, is that a known leak? We help ecommerce brands fix that by optimizing revenue pages for SEO. Our technical fixes and keyword strategy for collections have driven [Proof Result] for similar stores.
