Overall: 8

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener is hesitant and repetitive ("If it's not, if it's not relevant").
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Start with confident, direct permission and state your name/company clearly.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Hi, is this [Prospect]? [Your Name] with [Company] - do you have 20 seconds for a quick question about your new patient calls?"

- Issue: Value claim is a run-on sentence and slightly confusing.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): State the core benefit in one clear, simple sentence.
  Better line (word-for-word): "We provide an AI receptionist that texts back missed calls instantly to capture and book those new patients you're currently losing."

- Issue: The "proof placeholder" is implied but not explicitly stated.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Use a brief, credible proof statement to build trust before the close.
  Better line (word-for-word): "We do this for [Industry] businesses like [Competitor/Similar Business] and they typically save [X] leads a month."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
- "We already have voicemail / website form"
  Response: "Exactly, and when a new patient in pain hits voicemail, they often just call the next [Industry] business. This texts them back in 10 seconds to stop that leak—it's a safety net, not a replacement."

- "Sounds expensive"
  Response: "It's less than the cost of one new patient. If it saves just one call a month that would've gone to voicemail, it pays for itself. Can I show you the math?"

- "I'm busy"
  Response: "That's exactly why I called. This saves your team time on missed calls. 20 seconds: is losing new patient calls to voicemail a problem you'd want to fix?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Hi [Prospect], [Your Name] with [Company] - 20-second question about your new patient calls?"
2. "When the phone rings off the hook, do new patient calls ever go to voicemail?"
3. "Every missed call is a new patient calling your competitor next."
4. "We fix that with an AI that texts back missed calls in under 10 seconds."
5. "It captures their info, qualifies them, and books them directly into your calendar."
6. "It uses your branding and scripts, so it sounds like your team."
7. "For [Industry] clients, this saves an average of [X] leads per month."
8. "This isn't a call center; it's a 24/7 lead capture tool for when you're busy."
9. "The goal is to stop the leak, not change your workflow."
10. "Best next step: a 10-minute call tomorrow or a quick text demo now?"

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
"Hi [Prospect], [Your Name] with [Company]. Quick 20-second question? When you're with a client, do new patient calls ever go to voicemail? [PAUSE]. We provide an AI receptionist that texts back those missed calls instantly to capture and book them. We do this for [Industry] businesses like [Client Example] and they typically save [X] leads a month. To see if it fits, is a 10-minute call better tomorrow at 2 PM or 4 PM?"
