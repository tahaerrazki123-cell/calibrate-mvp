## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: No permission to engage.
  Fix rule: Always ask for permission to speak before stating your purpose.
  Better line: "Hi, is this [Prospect]? Quick question - do you have 27 seconds for a quick idea about your shop's website?"

- Issue: Leading with company name, not prospect's problem.
  Fix rule: Lead with a specific, relevant pain point, not your company.
  Better line: "I help barbershops fix their slow mobile websites that turn away clients trying to book."

- Issue: No control over the frame; prospect immediately set a hostile tone.
  Fix rule: Use a strong, assumptive permission-based opener to establish a professional frame from the first second.
  Better line: "Hey [Prospect], calling about [Shop]'s website - got 30 seconds to see if this makes sense?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm busy / Not interested."**
    "Totally get it, that's why I kept it short. Most shops I talk to are frustrated that their website is too slow on phones for clients to book. If that's not a problem, I'll hang up. Is it?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Quick question: when a client is on their phone looking for a haircut, does your site load fast and let them book in under 3 clicks? Because [Proof Result] of mobile visitors leave if it doesn't."

3.  **"Send me an email."**
    "I can, but emails about websites get deleted. Is it okay if I text you a link to an example for a shop like yours so you can see the speed on your phone? Takes 5 seconds."

"Hi, is this [Prospect]? Quick question - do you have 30 seconds for an idea about [Shop]'s website? I help barbershops fix their slow mobile sites that turn away clients trying to book.
