- Issue: No permission or context before stating company name.
  Fix rule: Ask for permission to state your purpose before introducing your company.
  Better line: "Hi, I'm calling about your barbershop's online presence—is this a quick chat or a bad time?"

- Issue: No immediate, relevant value anchor.
  Fix rule: Lead with a specific, common pain point for barbershops.
  Better line: "Quick question: when new clients find you online, can they easily see your services and book an appointment?"

- Issue: Pushing through clear hostility.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge the resistance politely and offer a low-pressure exit.
  Better line: "Sounds like I caught you at a bad moment. My apologies. Can I simply text you one example of what we do for shops like yours?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm not interested."**
    "Totally fair—most calls aren't welcome. I'm only calling because barbershops like [Shop] often tell us new clients struggle to book online. Can I just text you a before/after example of a shop we helped?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Many of our clients had one too, but it wasn't bringing in new bookings. Quick check: when someone finds your site on their phone, can they see your prices and book in under 30 seconds?"

3.  **"I'm too busy / Not now."**
    "I respect that completely. Is it okay if I text you a link to one example of a mobile-friendly site we did? No reply needed—you can just glance at it when you have 10 seconds."
