## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: No permission or rapport before pitching.
  Fix rule: Always ask for permission to ask a question before stating your purpose.
  Better line: "Hi, is this [Prospect]? Quick question—do you have 27 seconds for me?"

- Issue: Leading with "we build websites" instead of a prospect-specific problem.
  Fix rule: Lead with a specific, relevant pain point, not your solution.
  Better line: "I help barbershops like [Shop] get more clients from their phones."

- Issue: No recovery from immediate hostility; kept pushing the pitch.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge the resistance immediately and pivot to a permission-based question.
  Better line: "Sounds like I caught you at a bad time. Can I ask one quick question about your shop's online presence?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm not interested." / "Get away from me."**
    "Totally get it—I'm not selling right now. Just one question: when clients look for [Shop] on their phone, does your site show your services and prices clearly, or is it hard to use?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Most shops we work with had a site, but it wasn't bringing in clients. Quick check: does it let customers book appointments directly from their phone?"

3.  **"I'm too busy."**
    "That's exactly why I'm calling. We handle everything so you don't have to. Can I text you two examples of what we did for shops like yours? Takes 10 seconds to see."
