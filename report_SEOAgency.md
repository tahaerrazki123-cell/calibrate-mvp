## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 2 (Permission-based but vague; prospect immediately defensive)
Rapport: 1 (Zero rapport built; transactional from start)
Discovery: 7 (Good probing on spend and product category)
Objections: 6 (Handled "burned by agencies" well; others weak)
Close: 8 (Got a meeting booked)
Overall: 5 (Successful outcome despite poor process; high friction)

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener creates immediate suspicion and friction.
  Fix rule: State your name, company, and specific reason for calling in the first 5 seconds.
  Better line: "Hi Sarah, this is Trent from [Company]. I'm calling because we help [Industry] businesses like yours capture the 80% of leads that hang up or get missed."

- Issue: "Do you want more revenue?" is a worthless, insulting question.
  Fix rule: Ask about a specific, common operational pain point instead of a generic desire.
  Better line: "Quick question: when a new lead calls your business, are they speaking to a live person or going to voicemail most of the time?"

- Issue: Rambling, multi-sentence explanations before securing interest.
  Fix rule: After stating your purpose, ask a single, direct qualifying question to engage.
  Better line: "The reason I'm calling is our AI receptionist answers those missed calls instantly, captures the lead, and can even book estimates. Are missed calls a problem you're trying to solve?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
- "We already have voicemail / website form"
  Response: "Exactly, and most people hang up on voicemail and won't fill out a form. Our system texts them back in 20 seconds while they're still hot, converting those missed calls into booked appointments your team never even knew about."
- "Sounds expensive"
  Response: "It's less than half the cost of a part-time receptionist. For [Price]/month, it captures and qualifies leads 24/7. Can I text you a 30-second demo so you can see the value?"
- "I'm busy"
  Response: "I'll be quick. Do you lose leads when the phone isn't answered? Yes or no? [If Yes] Then my next call is 10 minutes to show you how we fix that. 2 PM or 4 PM tomorrow?"
