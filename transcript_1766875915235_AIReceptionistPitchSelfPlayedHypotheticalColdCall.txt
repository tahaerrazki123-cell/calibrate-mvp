Speaker A: Rep. Hi, is this the front desk at Bright Smile Dental? Prospect yes, this is the front desk. Rep hey, quick one, My name's Trent. I know you're busy so I'll keep this 20 seconds. If it's not, if it's not relevant, you can stop me. Fair. Prospect okay, go ahead. Rep. When your phone spike like lunch after school or when you're checking patients in, do calls ever go to voicemail or get put on hold for too long? Prospect Sometimes yeah. Rep. Got it. We set up an AI receptionist that answers missed calls and texts back immediately to capture the patient pre qualify and either book them to route them to your team so you lose fewer new patients. Prospect we already have voicemail and online booking. Rep. Totally. Quick question. When someone calls in pain and hits voicemail, do they wait or call the next dentist? Prospect Honestly, they'd probably call around. Rep. Exactly. This is about preventing that leak. It's not about replacing your staff, just catching overflow in after hours so your team isn't slammed. Prospect Is this like a call center? We don't want something that sounds robotic. Rep. Fair concern. It's a branded voice that uses your scripting hours, insurance basics, new patient offers emergency routing and if it's unsure, it transfers or schedules a callback. Would it help if missed calls got a text back in under 10 seconds saying this is Bright Smile. How can we help? Prospect maybe, but we are not looking for big changes right now. Rep. Understood. Let me ask, are you trying to grow new patients this quarter or are you more focused on retention and hygiene reactivation? Prospect. New patients mostly. Rep Then this matters because every missed new patient call is basically lost revenue. Once a new patient worth to you roughly couple hundred more? Prospect it depends. But yeah, a few hundred. Rep. Exactly. If this save, even if this saves even a handful of calls a month, it pays for itself. I can text you a 30 second demo of how it sounds for a dental office. Want me to send that? Prospect sure you can send it. Rep Great. What number should I text it to? Prospect this number is fine. Rep. Perfect. And so I send the right version. Do you get more missed calls for new patient bookings or emergency pain calls? Prospect. New patient bookings. Rep. Got it. I'll text a demo now if it looks good. Is a quick 10 minute call tomorrow afternoon better? Like 2 or 4 o'? Clock? Prospect 4 maybe. Rep. Cool. 4 works. I'll text you a calendar option after you watch. Appreciate it.
