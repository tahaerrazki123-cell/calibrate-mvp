Speaker A: Hey, is this Sarah? Prospect. Who is this and how did you get my number? Fair question. I'm Trent. Find your contacts on your site LinkedIn. I'll be 15 seconds. If it's not relevant, I'll disappear. Cool. Prospect. Make it fast. Rep. You're spending on ads, right? Quick. Yes or no? Do you want more revenue? That doesn't depend on increasing a spend. Prospect. Everyone wants that. We've tried SEO. It's useless. Rep. Totally hear you. Usually SEO fails because agencies chase blog traffic instead of ranking money pages. Two seconds. Are you shopify? Prospect. Yes. Rep. Got it. Then the fastest wins are technical plus collection page structure plus internal links. Stuff that actually moves product pages up. Prospect. Just email me. Rep. I can, but I don't want to send garbage. What should the email Prove to earn? 10 minutes more traffic, more revenue. More revenue or lower SCAC? Prospect revenue obviously. Rep. Good. Then here's the deal. I'll send a one page revenue audit. 10 specific fixes plus 5 keywords your competitors rank for that buyer's actually search, no fluff. If it's weak, ignore me. Prospect. And what does it cost? Rep. Depends on size. But I'll be straight. Most brands your level are in the 2k to 6k month range. Before you react. Before you react. What's your monthly ad spend? Prospect. Around 30k. Rep. So if we add even 10% more revenue from organic over time, that's meaningful. But I'm not asking you to buy today. Just look at an audit. Prospect. We already have an in house writer. Rep. Perfect. And we don't need more writing. We need a plan that tells your writer what pages to build and how to link them. So Google ranks your products, not blog posts. Prospect. We've been burned. Agencies over promise. Rep. Same. That's why I'm not promising. I'm offering proof. If the audit shows clear gaps and you agree they matter, then we talk. If not, we're done. Prospect. Fine. Email it. Rep. What's the best email? Prospect. Sarand.com rep. Got it. Last question. So it's targeted. What's your number one hero product category? Vitamin retinol, acne, Something else. Prospect Retinol. Rep. Perfect. I'll send the audit focused on retinal keywords plus the competitor pages dealing with that traffic. If it's solid, can we do 15 minutes tomorrow? 11 or 2 o'? Clock? Prospect. 2 o'. Clock. Rep. Done. I'll send it today. And a calendar for two o'. Clock. Appreciate it.
