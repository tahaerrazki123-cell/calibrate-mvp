## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener is weak and asks for permission ("Can I take 20 seconds?"), inviting an instant "No."
  Fix rule: State your purpose and their potential problem immediately without asking for time.
  Better line: "Hey Trent, it's [Your Name] - the reason for the call is we help Apex Roofing capture the emergency leak calls you're missing after 5pm."

- Issue: No rapport built; jumped straight into a generic pitch against a wall of resistance.
  Fix rule: Anchor your reason to a specific, high-stakes scenario they know is painful.
  Better line: "When a storm hits or someone calls with a leak after hours, that lead usually calls two more roofers before you even see the voicemail."

- Issue: Failed to control the frame; kept talking after clear "stop" signals, damaging any future contact.
  Fix rule: When you get a hard "stop," respect it immediately and reframe to a low-friction exit.
  Better line: "Understood, I'll note that. Last thing: if you ever do have a problem with missed calls costing jobs, the fix is one text away. Have a good one."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "I'm not buying anything / Stop calling":** "Totally fair, Trent - this isn't a sales call right now. It's just a quick way to stop losing the leak calls you're already missing. Can I shoot you a single text to show you what it looks like?"
2. **To "We're busy":** "That's exactly why I called. When you're swamped, calls get missed and that's money walking to your competitors. This just auto-texts those callers so you still get the lead."
3. **To "I don't care":** "Most roofers don't, until they realize how many [Industry] jobs they're losing to the next guy who answers. It takes 30 seconds to see if it's for you. Can I text you the example?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Hey Trent, it's [Your Name] - calling about the emergency leak calls Apex Roofing misses after hours."
2. "When a homeowner calls with a leak at 6pm, they typically call two more roofers before you even get the voicemail."
3. "We fix that with an automatic text-back to capture that lead instantly."
4. "It's not a new line or extra work - it just texts the numbers you already miss."
5. "The goal is to stop those jobs from going to your competitors."
6. "I'm not selling anything on this call."
7. "Can I simply text you a real example of how it works?"
8. "You'll see exactly what the homeowner gets when they call and you're busy or closed."
9. "If it makes sense, we can talk. If not, no problem."
10. "What's the best mobile number to send that to?"

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi, is this the owner or dispatcher? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? Quick question: when calls come in after hours or during storm rush, do leads ever hit voicemail and then call the next roofer? We fix that with missed-call text-back and lead intake so you capture the job instead of losing it. Roofers using it see [Proof Result]. Can I text you a 20-second example?
