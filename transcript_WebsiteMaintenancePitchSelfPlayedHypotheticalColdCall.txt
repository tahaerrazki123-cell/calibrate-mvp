Speaker A: Foreign. Yo, is this King's Cut? Barbershop? Prospect yeah. Who's this? Rep. My name's Trent. Super quick. I'll keep it 20 seconds. If it's not relevant, just tell me. Cool. Prospect. All right. Rep. Quick question. When people search you on Google or Instagram, can they book in like two taps and does your site show clean photos, prices and hours? Prospect. We mostly use Instagram. Rep. Makes sense. A lot of shops do. The issue is people still Google you and if the website slow, ugly or outdated, they bounce to the shop down the street. We build a clean site plus handle updates, monthly photos, pricing services and we cut and we connect your booking link so you get more appointments. Prospect we already have a website. Rep. Got it. When's the last time you updated it? Like in the last month or has it been since sitting? Prospect it's been a while. Rep. That's the opportunity. Two things we typically fix, the mobile experience and the book. Now flow. If your website could pull even five extra book cuts a week, would that matter? Prospect. Maybe, but I'm not trying to spend crazy money. Rep. Totally fair. What's an average cut for you? 30, 40, 60? Prospect like 40? Rep. So five extra cuts a week is $200 a week or $800 a month. This isn't branding fluff. It's an appointment machine. We do a simple package. We rebuild the site once, then small monthly maintenance so it doesn't rot. Prospect I don't want to deal with a bunch of tech stuff. Rep. That's the whole point. You don't. You text us photos and changes. We handle it. No logging into anything. Prospect how long does it take? Rep. Site rebuild is usually a few days. Once we have your photos, service hours, booking link, then maintenance is ongoing. I continue two example barbershop sites we've done. Do you want those? Prospect yes, send them. Rep. Bet. What number should I text them to? Prospect this number. Rep. Perfect. Last thing. What's your priority? More walk ins or more bookings or higher ticket? Like add ons? Prospect More bookings. Rep. Got it. I'll send examples now. If you like the styles, we can do a 10 minute call to price it properly. Tomorrow 2 or 5 o' clock better. Prospect 5 o'? Clock. Rep. Cool. I'll text you the examples and a quick reminder for five o'. Clock. Appreciate you.
