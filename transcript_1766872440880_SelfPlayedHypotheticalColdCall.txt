Speaker A: Rep. Hi, is this Mike? Prospect Yeah this is Mike. Who's this? Rep. Mike Totally fair. My name's Trent. I'm calling from Calibrate. Super quick. I'll keep this to 20 seconds and you can hang up if it's irrelevant or fair. Prospect. All right, go ahead. Rep. Do you guys ever miss calls when you're on a job? Like can you customer calls and it goes to voicemail? Prospect. Yeah that happens. We're busy. Rep. Exactly. We set up an AI receptionist plus instant text back so every missed call gets answered and the lead gets booked or at least captured so you're not bleeding jobs. Prospect. We already have voicemail on a website forum for that. Rep. Makes sense. Quick question. When someone leaves a voicemail, do they usually wait or do they just call the next company on Google? Prospect. They probably call the next company. Rep Right. That's the whole problem. Our system texts them back in under five seconds, asks three questions and either books to estimate or sends you the info. Prospect Sounds expensive. Rep. Fair. Most people assume that ballpark. It's usually less than the value of one job a month. What's an average ticket for you? Like 200, 500, $2,000? Prospect depends. Maybe like 600 on average. Rep. Got it. So if this saves you even one missed $600 job a month, it pays for itself. But before price, do you want more booked estimates without hiring another admin? Prospect sure, but I'm busy right now. Rep. Totally. Two points. I can send a 30 second video showing exactly how it works. Or Rep. We can do a quick 10 minute call later today and I'll tell you if it's even a fit. Which is better? Prospect. Just send the video. Rep. I can do that. What's the best email or number to text it to? Prospect. Text it to this number. Rep. Perfect. And last thing. And last quick thing so I can send the right version. Are you mainly trying to book more estimates or reduce no shows? Prospect. Book more estimates. Rep. Got it. I'll text a demo in two minutes if it looks useful. What time tomorrow is easiest for 10 minutes. Morning or afternoon? Prospect Afternoon. Rep Cool. I'll text you a couple of times. Appreciate it. Mike.
