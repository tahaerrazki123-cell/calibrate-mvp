Oftentimes the balance of volume and quality is off. So they're sending a ton out, making lots of calls. But really low conversion rates. Some people have the opposite. They're really converting high, but they can't scale that.

You said your SDO organization is more of the problem there. So it sounds like opening the doors and the volume thing would be more of the problems that I mentioned, if I got that right. You said you had two minutes, Megan, and it looks like you've probably got a 2pm meeting or something like that. Along the lines of that, would you be open to maybe 15 minutes next week?
