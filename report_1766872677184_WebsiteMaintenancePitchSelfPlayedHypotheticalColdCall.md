## 0) Context Check
Cold call to a barbershop owner/manager. Rep is selling a website rebuild and maintenance service. The primary goal of getting permission to text examples was achieved.

## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 7 (Direct, quick, uses a relevant question)
Rapport: 6 (Casual tone works, but could be more personal)
Discovery: 8 (Good probing on website status, average cut price, and priority)
Objections: 9 (Handled "have a site," "cost," and "tech stuff" very effectively)
Close: 10 (Secured text permission, set a clear next step with a time)
Overall: 8

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: The opener's "Foreign" and "Yo" are too informal and could undermine credibility.
  Fix rule: Start with a clear, professional greeting that states your name and company.
  Better line: "Hi, is this the owner or manager? My name is Trent with [Company]."

- Issue: The value prop "we cut and we connect your booking link" is grammatically awkward.
  Fix rule: Use clear, benefit-focused language.
  Better line: "We build a clean site, connect your booking link, and handle all the updates so you get more appointments."

- Issue: The question "When's the last time you updated it? Like in the last month or has it been since sitting?" is a bit clunky.
  Fix rule: Ask a simple, direct question to expose the problem.
  Better line: "When was the last time you updated it?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "We already have a website."**: "Got it. When was the last time you updated it?"
2. **To "I'm not trying to spend crazy money."**: "Totally fair. What's an average cut for you? [Prospect Answer]. So five extra cuts a week is [Calculated Value] a month. This isn't branding fluff. It's an appointment machine."
3. **To "I don't want to deal with a bunch of tech stuff."**: "That's the whole point. You don't. You text us photos and changes. We handle it. No logging into anything."

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. Hi, is this the owner or manager at King's Cut?
2. My name is Trent with [Company]. I'll be super quick.
3. Quick question: when people find you on Google, can they see your prices, photos, and book in two taps?
4. Most shops I talk to use Instagram, but if your Google listing or website is slow, you're losing bookings.
5. We fix that. We build a fast mobile site that connects directly to your booking system.
6. We also handle all the updates—you just text us new photos or price changes.
7. The goal is simple: turn your online presence into an appointment machine.
8. If your site could pull in just a few extra appointments a week, would that be valuable?
9. Perfect. I've got two examples from other barbershops.
10. Can I text them to this number so you can see the style?

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hey, is this the owner or manager? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? Quick question: when people Google your shop, can they see prices and book in two taps, or do they bounce? A slow site sends clients to the shop down the street. We build a fast mobile site and handle updates so you don’t have to. Our shops see [Proof Result] in bookings. Can I text you two local examples?
