## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 3
Rapport: 4
Discovery: 6
Objections: 8
Close: 9
Overall: 6

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener is weak and creates immediate friction by asking "how did you get my number?"
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Immediately state your name, company, and a high-value, specific reason for calling that aligns with the prospect's role.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Hi Sarah, this is Trent from [Company]. I help e-commerce brands like yours rank their product pages to reduce ad spend dependency - I've got one specific idea for your site, 30 seconds?"

- Issue: Rapport is damaged by using a pushy, rapid-fire questioning style ("Quick. Yes or no?").
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Use a collaborative, assumptive tone that frames you as a peer diagnosing a common business problem.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Most of the brands I talk to are spending heavily on ads but find SEO hasn't worked because it was focused on the wrong things. Is that a fair assessment of your experience?"

- Issue: Discovery question "Do you want more revenue?" is generic and wastes precious seconds.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Assume the desired outcome and ask a discovery question that reveals their current strategy or a specific pain point.
  Better line (word-for-word): "I'm calling because I see a pattern where brands spending on [Industry] ads are leaving 10-20% of revenue on the table from unranked product pages. Are you measuring organic revenue separately right now?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "We've tried SEO. It's useless."**: "Exactly, and that's usually because the strategy was wrong—focused on blog traffic that doesn't convert. We only work on the technical and linking structure that gets your actual product and collection pages to rank. Can I show you the difference in 60 seconds?"
2. **To "We already have an in-house writer."**: "Perfect. That means you have the content engine; our service provides the blueprint. We'd identify the exact pages and internal links your writer needs to focus on so their work drives sales, not just traffic."
3. **To "We've been burned. Agencies over promise."**: "I don't blame you. That's why I'm not selling you a service right now—I'm asking you to judge some proof. If this one-page audit doesn't show you clear, actionable gaps on your revenue pages, then I've wasted your time and you can tell me to get lost."

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. Hi Sarah, Trent from [Company] - I help Shopify brands reduce their reliance on paid ads.
2. The reason for the call: I've seen a pattern where SEO fails because it targets blog posts, not product pages.
3. For e-commerce, the only SEO that matters is what ranks your collections and hero products.
4. My question is: are you tracking how much revenue comes from organic search versus ads today?
5. (If Yes) What percentage is organic currently driving?
6. (If No/Skeptical) Most brands we start with find it's under 10%, leaving a major channel untapped.
7. I'm not selling anything now. I'd like to send you a one-page audit of your site.
8. It will show 3-5 technical fixes and the top competitor keywords you're missing for your hero category.
9. You judge it. If it's not valuable, you delete it.
