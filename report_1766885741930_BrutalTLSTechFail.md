1.  "I don't want to talk to you people."
    Response: "I completely understand. I'm only calling because we have a specific process for brands like [Brand] to fix SEO leaks on their revenue pages. Can I just ask one quick question to see if it's relevant?"

2.  "We already have someone handling SEO."
    Response: "That's great. Most of our clients had an SEO partner before working with us. We focus narrowly on the technical fixes and keyword strategy for your money pages. Would you be open to a free, one-page comparison audit?"

3.  "I'm too busy / Not interested."
    Response: "Understood, it's a busy time. That's why our audit is one page and takes 15 minutes. It simply shows if your top product pages are missing easy technical wins for more organic revenue. Can I send it over?"
