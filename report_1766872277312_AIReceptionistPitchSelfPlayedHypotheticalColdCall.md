## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 7
Rapport: 5
Discovery: 6
Objections: 8
Close: 9
Overall: 7

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Rapport is transactional; the "20 seconds" and "stop me" framing is weak and defensive.
  Fix rule: Build credibility by stating your purpose and their common problem upfront.
  Better line: "Hi, this is Trent with [Company]. We help dental offices like yours capture new patients who call when the front desk is swamped. Do you have a quick minute?"

- Issue: Discovery question is leading and vague ("When your phone spike...").
  Fix rule: Ask simple, direct questions about specific, painful outcomes.
  Better line: "How many new patient calls would you estimate get missed or go to a long hold each week?"

- Issue: The value prop is delivered in a dense, jargon-heavy run-on sentence.
  Fix rule: Simplify the offer into one clear, outcome-focused statement.
  Better line: "We provide an AI that answers your overflow calls instantly, so you never miss a new patient booking."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. To "We already have voicemail and online booking": "Exactly, and that's the leak. Voicemail doesn't engage them. This texts them back in seconds to stop them from calling your competitor while they're still on the phone."
2. To "Is this like a call center? We don't want something robotic": "It's the opposite. It uses your exact office hours, insurance info, and scripts. It sounds like an extension of your team, just handling the initial filter so your staff gets warmer leads."
3. To "We are not looking for big changes right now": "Totally get that. This isn't a change for your team—it's a safety net that works in the background. Can I just show you a 30-second demo of how it captures a caller so you have it for the future?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. Hi, is this the front desk at [Practice]?
2. This is [Name] with [Company]. We help dental offices capture new patients who call when the line is busy.
3. Quick question: when the phones are slammed, do new patient calls ever go to voicemail or get put on a long hold?
4. (If yes) That's exactly what we fix.
5. We provide an AI receptionist that answers those missed calls instantly and texts the caller back within 10 seconds.
6. It captures their info, answers FAQs, and books appointments directly into your calendar.
7. It's designed specifically for dental offices, using your hours, insurance details, and scripts.
8. The goal is simple: stop losing new patients to voicemail.
9. The best way to see it is a quick demo. I can text you a 30-second video showing how it works for a practice like yours.
10. Would it be okay to send that to this number?

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi, is this the front desk? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? When the phones spike, do new patient calls ever go to voicemail? We fix that with an AI receptionist that answers missed calls and texts back immediately to capture and book them. Practices using it see [Proof Result]. Can I text you a 30-second demo?
