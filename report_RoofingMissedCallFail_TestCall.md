Close: 0
Overall: 1

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener is weak and asks for permission after being identified as a cold call.
  Fix rule: State your purpose and value immediately after confirming identity.
  Better line: "Trent, this is [Name] with [Company]. We help roofers like Apex capture the 30% of leads that call after hours by texting them back instantly so they don't call your competitor."

- Issue: No rapport built before pushing for a discovery question.
  Fix rule: Use a "permission bridge" after your value prop before asking a question.
  Better line: "The reason for my call is simple. Do you handle your own after-hours calls, or does a call center?"

- Issue: Pivoted poorly after the first "no" and kept pushing, causing irritation.
  Fix rule: When met with strong resistance, pivot to a low-commitment, high-value exit.
  Better line: "Understood, you're slammed. I'll just text you one example of how it works for [Industry] so you have it. Best of luck."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "I'm not buying anything / Stop calling":** "Totally fair, Trent, this isn't a sales call right now. I just wanted to see if losing after-hours leak calls is even a problem for you. If it's not, I'll note it and we're done."
2. **To "We're busy / I don't care":** "That's exactly why I'm calling—because you're busy. When you're swamped or it's after hours, that's when most roofers lose [Proof Result] of their leads. Quick yes or no: is that a issue you'd want to fix?"
3. **To initial "No" after opener:** "No problem at all. Most roofers I talk to say the same thing until they see the example. Can I just text it to you? You can review it when you have 30 seconds."

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Trent at Apex Roofing?"
2. "This is [Your Name]. We help roofers capture leads that call when you're closed or on another job."
3. "The reason I'm calling is simple."
4. "When a homeowner calls with a leak after hours, they call the next roofer if you don't answer."
5. "We fix that by auto-texting them in 90 seconds to capture their info."
6. "Quick question: do you use a call center for nights and weekends, or does it go to voicemail?"
7. "If it goes to voicemail, you're likely losing [Proof Result] of those leads."
8. "I'm not selling anything on this call."
9. "Can I just text you a real example of how it works for a roofer in [Prospect's City]?"
10. "If it's not relevant, you can just delete it."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi, is this the owner or dispatcher? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? Quick question: when calls come in after hours or during storm rush, do leads ever hit voicemail and then call the next roofer? We fix that with missed-call text-back and lead intake so you capture the job instead of losing it. Roofers using it see [Proof Result]. Can I text you a 20-second example?
