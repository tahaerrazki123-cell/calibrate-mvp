## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: No permission or rapport. Caller jumps straight to company name.
  Fix rule: Always ask for permission to speak before stating your purpose.
  Better line: "Hi, is this the owner or manager of [Shop]? I have a quick question about your website."

- Issue: No value anchor. The offer ("build websites") is generic and disconnected from the prospect's world.
  Fix rule: Immediately connect your service to a specific, relevant barbershop problem.
  Better line: "I help barbershops get more online bookings from mobile phones."

- Issue: No control over the frame. The caller reacts to hostility instead of resetting the conversation.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge the resistance politely and pivot to a low-commitment question.
  Better line: "I apologize for the interruption. My only question is, are you the one who handles the shop's online presence?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm busy / Not interested."**
    "Totally get it, you're running a shop. That's exactly why I keep it to 30 seconds: I help shops like yours turn mobile traffic into actual bookings. Can I ask one quick question about your site?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Most of our clients had one too, but it wasn't built for phones. We found [Proof Result] of mobile visitors leave if a site is slow. Are you happy with how many book from their phone?"

3.  **"I can't afford it."**
    "Understood. We focus on making the site pay for itself by capturing missed bookings. Before any cost talk, can I just text you two examples of what we did for shops like [Shop]? You can decide if it's relevant."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi, is this the owner or manager of [Shop]? I have a quick question about your website. Do you feel you're getting all the online bookings you should from mobile phones? I help barbershops fix that with a fast mobile site that shows services, prices, and a booking link. Our clients typically see [Proof Result]. To see if it makes sense for you, I just need 10 minutes. Can I schedule a quick call for tomorrow, or is it better if I text you some examples first?
