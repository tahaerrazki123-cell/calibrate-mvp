## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: No permission-based opener.
  Fix rule: Always ask for permission to speak before pitching.
  Better line: "Hi, is this [Prospect]? Quick question - are you the one who handles the website for [Shop]?"

- Issue: No rapport or acknowledgment of the prospect's time.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge they're busy before stating your business.
  Better line: "I know you're with clients, so I'll be quick."

- Issue: Leading with the company name instead of a relevant hook.
  Fix rule: Lead with a specific, relevant observation about *their* business.
  Better line: "I was looking at your shop's online booking and had a quick idea to share."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm busy / Not interested."**
    "Totally get it. Most barbershop owners we help said the same thing until they saw [Proof Result]. Can I just text you one example?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Most of our clients did too. We focus on making it load faster on phones so clients don't bounce - which led to [Proof Result] for shops like yours. Can I show you a 30-second comparison?"

3.  **"I can't afford it."**
    "Understood. We start by fixing the basics that bring in new appointments. For example, shops that improved their Google visibility saw [Proof Result]. Could we have a quick 10-minute call to see if it's a fit?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)

3.  "Do you ever get calls asking for prices or hours that are already on your site?"
4.  "We rebuild barbershop sites to be faster on phones."
5.  "A slow site can make potential clients book elsewhere."
6.  "We include a direct link for bookings to capture more appointments."
7.  "The goal is to turn web visitors into chair fills."
8.  "Shops that improved their mobile speed saw [Proof Result]."
9.  "Can I text you two examples of what we've done for other shops?"
10. "Would a brief 10-minute call this week work to see if it makes sense?"

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
"Hi, is this [Prospect]? Quick question - are you the one who handles the website for [Shop]? I'll be brief. When clients can't easily see your services or book on their phone, do you feel you miss out on appointments? We rebuild barbershop sites to be fast on mobile and link directly to bookings. Shops that improved this saw [Proof Result]. Can I text you two quick examples, or is a 10-minute call this week better?"
