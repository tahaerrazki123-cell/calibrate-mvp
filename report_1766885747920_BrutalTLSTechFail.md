- Issue: No permission or context before stating company name.
  Fix rule: Ask for permission to state your purpose before introducing your company.
  Better line: "Hi, I'm calling about your barbershop's online presence—is this a quick chat or a bad time?"

- Issue: No immediate, relevant value anchor.
  Fix rule: Lead with a specific, common pain point for barbershops.
  Better line: "Quick question: when new clients find you online, can they easily see your services and book an appointment?"

- Issue: Pushing through clear rejection.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge the brush-off immediately and pivot to a low-pressure exit.
  Better line: "Sounds like it's a bad time. My apologies. Can I simply text you one example of what we do for shops like [Shop]?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1.  **"I'm not interested."**
    "Totally fair—most calls aren't relevant. I only call barbershops where their online booking is broken or missing. Is that a headache for [Shop] at all?"

2.  **"I already have a website."**
    "Perfect. Many of our clients did too. Is it fast on mobile and do new clients actually use it to book, or do they still just call?"

3.  **"I'm too busy / Not now."**
    "Understood, running the shop comes first. Would a 10-minute call later this week work, or is it easier if I text over a quick example first?"

Our rebuilds make booking fast, which has led to [Proof Result] for shops like yours. The goal is more appointments from your site, not just a brochure.
