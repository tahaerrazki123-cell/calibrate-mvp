Speaker A: Hey, am I speaking with the owner at Apex Roofing? Who's this? Trent. Can I take, like, 20 seconds? No. What is this about? We help roofers stop losing leads when calls get missed. Missed call. Text back after hour capture, bro, I don't. I don't care. We're busy. Stop calling. Totally. Quick question, though. When someone calls after hours for a leak, do you listen? I'm not buying anything. Take me off your list. Got it. Before I go, is there. Is there something else I should. No, no, no. Don't call here again.
