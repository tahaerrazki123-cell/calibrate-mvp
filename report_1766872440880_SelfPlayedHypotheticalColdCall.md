Overall: 5

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: The call is for the wrong service (AI receptionist vs. SEO). The discovery questions are irrelevant to ecommerce SEO.
  Fix rule: Immediately establish context by naming the prospect's industry and your specific service.
  Better line: "Hi Mike, this is Trent from Calibrate. I help ecommerce brands like yours fix SEO leaks on their key revenue pages."

- Issue: The "20-second" opener is a cliché and doesn't provide value or context specific to their business.
  Fix rule: Replace time-based permission with a value-based, industry-specific hook.
  Better line: "Quick question: are you the right person to talk to about the SEO and conversion rate for your main product or collection pages?"

- Issue: The objection response "Fair. Most people assume that ballpark." is weak and concedes the price objection without a strong value anchor.
  Fix rule: Deflect price until value is established by linking cost directly to their lost revenue.
  Better line: "That's exactly why I'm not going to talk price yet. If I can show you a fix for pages that are already driving traffic but leaking [Proof Result] in potential revenue, would a 1-page audit make sense?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. (To "We already have voicemail/website form") "I get that. Most of our clients had a form too. The issue we fix isn't capturing leads, it's that the SEO driving traffic to those pages has technical errors that kill conversions. Can I ask, when you look at your Google Analytics, do you see product pages with traffic but a high bounce rate?"
2. (To "Sounds expensive." / "We have an agency.") "Totally fair. Before any cost, my goal is just to show you a specific leak. We focus purely on the product and collection pages that already get traffic. If I could email you a one-page snapshot showing one clear fix that could recover [Proof Result] in monthly revenue, would that be worth 60 seconds to review?"
3. (To "I'm busy right now.") "Mike, I respect that completely. I'll be brief. My only ask is permission to email you a one-page audit on one key revenue page. You review it on your time. If it's irrelevant, you delete it. If it shows a clear opportunity, we can talk for 5 minutes. Can I send that to you?"

1. "Hi Mike, Trent from Calibrate. I help ecommerce brands fix SEO leaks on their key revenue pages."
2. "Quick question: are you the right person for SEO and conversion rate on your main product pages?"
3. "We focus on technical fixes and keyword strategy for the pages that already drive your sales."
4. "I'm not selling anything on this call. I'd like to email you a focused, one-page audit of a key page."
5. "It will show one clear technical or content issue that's likely costing you conversions."
6. "You review it on your time. If it's irrelevant, you delete it."
7. "If it shows a clear revenue opportunity, we can have a 5-minute chat."
8. "The goal is to see if there's a fit, not to do a full presentation."
9. "Can I get your email to send that one-page snapshot over?"
10. "Perfect. I'll send it titled '[Your Brand] SEO Snapshot' within the hour."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi Sarah, Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? I help Shopify brands fix SEO leaks on key revenue pages. Quick question: are you spending on ads but want more revenue without increasing spend? Most SEO fails because it chases blog traffic, not money pages. We fix technical issues and internal linking so products and collections rank, which has driven [Proof Result] for others. Can I email you a one-page audit of your top collection page?
