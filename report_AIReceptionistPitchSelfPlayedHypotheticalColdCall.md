## 0) Context Check
Cold call to a dental front desk. Rep is selling an AI receptionist and text-back service. The call ends with permission to text a demo and a tentative 10-minute follow-up booked.

## 1) Scorecard (0-10)
Opener: 6 - Direct and asks for permission, but slightly hesitant.
Rapport: 5 - Generic, no personalization or specific practice praise.
Discovery: 7 - Good pain point questions, but missed deeper value quantification.
Objections: 8 - Handled objections well with reframing and clarification.
Close: 9 - Secured permission to text and a tentative follow-up effectively.
Overall: 7 - Functional and got a result, but the path was clunky and could be more direct/confident.

## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Weak, permission-based opener that undermines authority.
  Fix rule: Start with a confident, value-implying statement instead of asking for an allowance.
  Better line: "Hi, this is Trent. The reason for my call is we help dental offices like Bright Smile capture every new patient call, even when the front desk is swamped."

- Issue: Rambling, unclear value proposition on first pitch.
  Fix rule: Lead with the core benefit in one clear, concise sentence.
  Better line: "We provide an AI receptionist that instantly texts back missed calls to capture new patients who'd otherwise call your competitors."

- Issue: Asking for a follow-up before the prospect has seen/agreed to the value of the demo.
  Fix rule: Secure commitment to the next step (viewing the demo) before layering on another ask.
  Better line: "Great, I'll send that demo now. Once you've had a chance to see it, would a quick 10 minutes tomorrow make sense to see if it's a fit?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. **To "We already have voicemail and online booking":** "Exactly, most offices do. The gap is the patient who calls in pain or for a new appointment, gets voicemail, and immediately calls the next practice on Google. We close that gap instantly with a text."
2. **To "Is this like a call center? We don't want something robotic":** "Not at all. It's your branded assistant. We train it on your office hours, insurance info, and new patient offers so it sounds like an extension of your team, and it only handles the overflow to prevent those leaks."
3. **To "We are not looking for big changes right now":** "Totally get that. This isn't a big change—it works in the background. Given you're focused on new patients, it's really about plugging the revenue leak from missed calls. Can I just show you a 30-second demo of how it works?"
