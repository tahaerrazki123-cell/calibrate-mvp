## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener asks for time before establishing any value or relevance.
  Fix rule: Lead with a high-impact, specific, and relevant result, not a permission request.
  Better line: "Hey Trent, this is [Your Name]. The reason for the call is we help roofers like Apex capture an extra [Number] leads per month specifically from after-hours calls that go to voicemail."

- Issue: No rapport built; immediately confrontational when met with resistance.
  Fix rule: Acknowledge their state (busy, skeptical) and align with it before pushing forward.
  Better line: "Sounds like you're in the middle of it—I'll be super quick. I'm only calling because we fix a specific, expensive problem for roofers."

- Issue: Discovery question was asked far too late, after the prospect was already hostile.
  Fix rule: Weave a diagnostic question into the initial value statement to engage them.
  Better line: "When a homeowner calls with a leak after 5 PM, does that call just go to a generic voicemail, or does someone get it immediately?"

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
1. To "We're busy. Stop calling."
   "Totally get it—roofing season is chaos. That's actually why I called. When you're swamped, that's when the most expensive calls get missed. I can show you in 30 seconds how we auto-capture those. Can I text you a quick example?"

2. To "I'm not buying anything."
   "I'm not selling anything on this call. I just want to show you a text that goes out automatically when you miss a call, so you see what the homeowner sees. If it makes sense, great. If not, no problem. Can I send it?"

3. To "Don't call here again."
   "Understood, and I won't. Before I go, for my own learning: is it the timing of the call, or does this solution just not fit with how you handle leads? [Pause]. Got it. Thanks for your time."

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Hey Trent, [Your Name] here."
2. "Quick call—we help roofers capture the leads that call after hours or during storm overflow."
3. "When a homeowner calls with a leak and gets voicemail, they often just call the next roofer."
4. "We fix that by instantly texting them a link to schedule or get help."
5. "It works even when your team is off or swamped."
6. "The goal isn't to sell you on the call."
7. "It's to show you the exact text the homeowner gets."
8. "Can I text a 30-second example to this number?"
9. "You'll see it's not spam—it's a direct response to their missed call."
10. "If it's not a fit, just ignore it and I won't follow up."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
Hi, is this the owner or dispatcher? Trent here—can I take 20 seconds? Quick question: when calls come in after hours or during storm rush, do leads ever hit voicemail and then call the next roofer? We fix that with missed-call text-back and lead intake so you capture the job instead of losing it. Roofers using it see [Proof Result]. Can I text you a 20-second example?
