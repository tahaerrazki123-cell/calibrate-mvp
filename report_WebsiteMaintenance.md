## 2) What To Fix First (Top 3)
- Issue: Opener is for a different service (website) than the AI receptionist offer.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): The opener must immediately frame the conversation around the specific pain of missed calls and lead capture.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Hey [Prospect], quick question - when you're with a client or on another call, how are you currently handling the new calls that come in?"

- Issue: The "value claim" in the transcript is about websites, not the AI receptionist.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Every value claim must directly address the core offer of capturing and qualifying leads from missed calls.
  Better line (word-for-word): "Our system texts back every missed call in 30 seconds to capture their info and qualify them, so you only get back to hot leads ready to book."

- Issue: The "proof placeholder" references barbershop website examples, not AI receptionist results.
  Fix rule (1 sentence): Proof must be relevant social proof for the AI service, like results for similar [Industry] businesses.
  Better line (word-for-word): "For example, we helped a [similar business] capture 15 extra estimates last month they would've missed."

## 3) Best Objection Responses (word-for-word)
- "We already have voicemail / website form"
  Response: "Exactly, and most people hang up on voicemail. Our system texts them while they're still thinking of you, which gets a 70%+ reply rate to capture the lead voicemail misses."
- "Sounds expensive"
  Response: "It's less than the cost of one lost job. If it books just one extra [service] per month, it pays for itself. Can I show you the numbers?"
- "I'm busy"
  Response: "I'll be quick. This is about the calls you're missing while you're busy. 30 seconds: does losing those leads cost you more than [Price] a month?"

## 4) Rewrite Pack (10 lines)
1. "Hey [Prospect], do you ever miss a new client call because you're with another customer?"
2. "When that happens, does that lead just disappear to a competitor?"
3. "What we do is text every missed call back in 30 seconds to capture their info."
4. "It also asks a couple questions to see if they're serious and ready to book."
5. "That way, you only call back the hot leads, not the tire-kickers."
6. "For [Industry] businesses, this typically books 3-5 extra estimates a week."
7. "The goal is to turn missed calls into booked appointments automatically."
8. "It works 24/7, so you capture leads even when you're closed."
9. "Can I text you a 1-minute video showing how it works for a business like yours?"
10. "If you like it, we can hop on a 10-minute call tomorrow at 2 or 5 to see if it fits."

## 5) 45-Second Script (single best version)
"Hey [Prospect], quick question - when you're with a client and miss a new call, does that lead usually just disappear? (Pause). We fix that with an AI receptionist that texts every missed call back in 30 seconds to capture their info and qualify them. For example, we helped a [similar business] capture 15 extra estimates last month. If you could save even a few of those missed leads each week, would a 10-minute follow-up be worth it? I have time tomorrow at 2 or 5."
